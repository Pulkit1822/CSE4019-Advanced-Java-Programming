   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Pulkit1822/CSE4019-Advanced-Java-Programming.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Create a new database named `mydatabase`.
   - Create the necessary tables and insert sample data using the provided SQL scripts in the `sql` folder.

4. Update the database connection details in the Java files (e.g., `DatabaseDemo1.java`, `LoginFrame.java`) with your MySQL server credentials.

5. Compile and run the Java programs:
   - For command-line execution, navigate to the project directory and use the following commands:
     ```
     javac <JavaFileName>.java
     java <JavaFileName>
     ```
   - For IDE execution, use the built-in run/debug features of your IDE.
